## Introduction:

Consider 3 motors and there connection are as follows:
         #4 -> main motor
         #1-> X-axis
         #2->Y-Axis

Configuration of all motors are  
- main motor  2krpm ,1kw
- slave motor 3krpm,750w

![Figure 1](Image/1.png)

Main motor rotate for 10,000 counts/revolution.
So out of 10,000 pulse
1) In 1st 2,000 pulses, #1 and #2 should complete its task which is assigned to them the task is variable.
2) In 2nd 8,000 pulses,#1 and #2 should be rest.

### PMAC stands for Programmable Multi-Axis Controller

PMAC is one of the world‚Äôs most flexible and powerful motion controllers (& PLCs), it is used in a wide variety of applications ranging from the simplest to those requiring extremely high performance. Requirements such as accuracy, precision, speed, and power, whether combined or independently.

## Time Base Operation:
PMAC motion trajectory is usually defined as a position vs. time function

The operating principle of Time Base Control is to replace time with master position to create a position vs. position trajectory function

The relationship between real time and nominal master position is called the Real-Time Input Frequency (RTIF). 

RTIF (cts/msec):	 nominal speed of master position (i.e. when Feedrate = 100%)

![Figure 2](Image/TB1.PNG)

After the RTIF is determined , the real speed of the master position will become an input comparing to RTIF to determine Feedrate. This is called the Input Frequency (IF)

IF (cts/msec):	Real speed of master encoder

![Figure 3](Image/TB2.PNG)

% Feedrate of a time-base-controlled coordinate system is determined by the IF/RTIF ratio, which means that when the master is speeding up, the motion of that coordinate system will also speed up accordingly

### PMAC %Feedrate calculation and Isx93

On power-on ,or $$$ reset, or command ‚Äú%100‚Äù, the value of I10 will be copied once to the addresses specified by Isx93, Coordinate System x Time Base Control Address.
Let the value in Isx93 address be VIsx93, and then the Feedrate value is determined by the following equation:

![Figure 4](Image/TB3.png)

If Isx93 is pointing to an address which contains the value of the related calculation result from IF and RTIF, then the Feedrate will change according to that result

### TBSF: Time Base Scale Factor

The time base setup in PMAC used TBSF instead of RTIF
The relationship is as follows:

![Figure 5](Image/TB5.PNG)

N=17 for normal time base
N=14 for triggered time base

### TBSF needs to be and INTEGER

If a RTIF is chosen and the corresponding TBSF is not an integer, then move durations may not be accurate since the register of TBSF will ignore decimal values.
Usually if RTIF is chosen as 2^ùëõ/ùëñùëõùë°ùëíùëîùëíùëü(ùëõ‚â§ùëÅ), then TBSF will be an integer.

If for any reason a RTIF must be selected to have non-integer TBSF, then a MTSF, Move Time Scale Factor, must be implemented for move time adjustment.
