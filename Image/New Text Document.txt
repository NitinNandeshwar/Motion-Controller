Dear Sir,

Sir, i need your help in solving following problem.
i am attaching the following code which i prepared based on nantex requirement.

what he expect is that their is 3 motors
Consider #4 -> main motor
                #1-> X-axis
                #2->Y-Axis

Main motor rotate for 10,000 counts/revolution.
So out of 10,000 pulse
1)In 1st 2,000 pulses, #1 and #2 should complete its task which is assigned to them
   the task is variable.
2)In 2nd 8,000 pulses,#1 and #2 should be rest.

I am attaching the program diagram which will add more understanding of the problem.

what i have done is i used time base control in which #4 is master and #1 &#2 is slave.
then i calculate the time in which master completes the 2000 pulses i.e TM1000
then i will come out of time base control mode.

what i am facing problem is it is completing its task in TM1000 ,
so i want to know is their any way by which we can perform the task in 2000pulses of master duration .

 
Thanks and Regards
